# SimpleFusion

A simple library that applies a complementary filter to accelerometer and 
gyroscope readings (6-dof IMU) in order to achieve an accurate estimation 
of the pitch and roll of a gyroscope.

### Benefits

Complementary filters attempt to do something similar to a Kalman filter, 
however are much faster and easier to understand. Kalman filters, however,
are typically more accurate (but they can be pretty similar) and can be 
applied to a greater range of problems.

Sooner or later, I'll publish this as an official Arduino library... once I've 
done more testing and ironed out the bugs ðŸ˜‰.
